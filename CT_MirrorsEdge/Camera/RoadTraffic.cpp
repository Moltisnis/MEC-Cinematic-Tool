// Road traffic (2026-11-03; Research_Road_Traffic_2026-11-03.md). The city's road cars are members of one swarm
// (levels/sp/sp_maincity/crowds/cars/carcrowd_01), driven by 21 car placements (CrowdPlacementBoidsEntity), each
// with a Car behaviour object (vtable 0x141CCEF20, at placement + 0xA8) whose step 0x143B8B0D0(behaviour, params)
// moves all of the placement's cars once an update: params + 0 its node list, + 8 its CrowdBoidsSettings, + 0x10 the
// step's seconds. The game's step chases each car's next corner at a capped turn rate and only avoids the cars it
// finds on its own two nodes (none on the highway, whose settings have AvoidanceEnabled false), and its spawn
// (0x143B99C40) puts a respawned car on its spawn node whether or not one is there; the research has why cars leave
// the road and end up inside each other.
//
// What the tools do, in the game's own step (no pass of their own, no menu entry):
// - the game's step runs with a copy of the placement's settings with AvoidanceEnabled cleared (the rules keep the
//   gaps): params + 8 points at the copy for the call and back after; the settings asset itself isn't written;
// - before it, the rules note each car; after it, they move each car along its lane by at most what the game moved
//   it, keeping its gap to the cars in its way, and make the ones that would show inside another unseen
//   (RoadTrafficCore.h); a car the game has just respawned starts unseen and shows where there's room;
// - an unseen car is at y -10000: under the world, but above the game's despawn height -10042, so the game keeps it in
//   its node lists as it does a shown car (RoadTrafficCore.h, HiddenY: at -10042 the lists broke and the game crashed,
//   7BFAC1779936). The game updates a swarm only while it's needed, going by its placements' boxes [inferred]: the
//   11413E1A2147 build hid every car as the game first spread them (a spawn hook, gone now), the boxes ended 10 km under
//   the city, the car swarm was never updated and no car showed (2026-11-03). Nothing is hidden before the rules have
//   stepped a placement but a car inside another, and whenever the rules can't step one its unseen cars are put back.
// The step's caller (0x143B9B7E0) builds params on its stack: + 0 placement + 0x78 (the node vector), + 8 the settings
// ([[placement + 0x30] + 0x80]), + 0x10 the seconds (0 < dt <= 0.3: 0x143B92E00 clamps it, 0x143B9BC10 skips 0).
// The member records: the swarm's data store (placement + 0x98) column of key [0x141CCD778] (0x24 bytes a car, the
// placement's first at index [placement + 0xA0]), the flags column of key [0x141CCD780] (2 bytes a car, bit 3
// despawned); their count at placement + 0x48 (what the step gets from its + 0x38 part's slot 4); the nodes at
// [placement + 0x78] .. [placement + 0x80], 0x30 bytes each.
//
// Walking people and the time of day (2026-11-03, the research's section 8):
// - the walkers' step (the Pedestrians behaviour, vtable 0x141CCEED8: 0x143B8CF00(behaviour, params), params as the
//   cars') with the rules of WalkersCore.h round it: the unseen walkers marked despawned for the step only (the step
//   skips them), then after it each shown walker's move cut short or turned into a sidestep so it never ends inside
//   another; boats use the same behaviour and are left alone (their MemberRadius 12, a walker's 0.2 - 0.5);
// - the standing crowds (the Idle behaviour, vtable 0x141CCEEA0, no step) through the placement's per-frame update
//   0x143B9B7E0(placement, dt, time, ...), after the game's: only the time of day's share;
// - the time of day's share (DayShare): the game's clock ([[[OFFSET_TIMEOFDAY] + 8] + 0x28] + 0x30, seconds, as the
//   tools' time of day menu reads it); all of a crowd shows by day, CarsAtNight / PeopleAtNight of it at night. What
//   goes or comes for it does so out of sight of the view the game's walker step goes by (0x143B8CFE5: 0x143278E10 on
//   [0x142415E50], ids 0, 0; its translation and forward rows), read here without the game's lock (a frame off at worst,
//   and only for what's out of sight). The game's own respawn is held back to the share too: it brings a despawned
//   member back only while more than the despawner's ([behaviour + 0x18]) + 0x34 are despawned (0x143B9CC31), which
//   the update sets before the step from TargetSpawnedPercentage (0x143B9B8D1); the rules raise it, never lower it.
//   With no view known there's no share (all shows).
//
// More by day (2026-11-03, the research's sections 9 and 10): the road cars' crowd gets 2000 cars (the level's 1210;
// the highway and placement 93 keep theirs, see Cars) and the three big walking crowds (the pedestrians', the mid
// caste's and the high caste's) twice the members the level gives them. A crowd's room is its SwarmEntityData's MaxAgentCount, which sizes every per-member column when the
// crowd is made (its components' constructors, the renderer's buffers) and caps its placements when they register
// (0x143B97430: one that doesn't fit gets no members); a placement's members are its data's MaxCrowdMembers. Both are
// raised in the level data as the game makes each entity, in its factory (0x143B880B0 the crowd's, 0x143B8DE90 a
// placement's: the data at the creation info's + 0xD0), before anything reads them, so the game sizes everything for
// the raised counts itself. The crowds are matched by their room (1300, 901, 800, 721: no other crowd has these), the
// placements by their settings asset's name; every other crowd stays as the level has it. At night the raised crowds'
// share is smaller by as much, so nights stay as they were.
//
// The crowd test (MISC > Performance, 2026-11-03; the weather session for the user, who asked whether the many cars
// and people make the game lag: what twice the crowds cost the frame, measured): three phases in one place, as set,
// then the level's crowds, then as set again, each 20 s measured after 5 s to settle (the third 10 s). In the second, each raised
// placement's share is its level count (the extra cars and walkers go unseen as the time of day's share would make
// them), in sight too; in the third they show again where there's room, in sight too. The frame times come from the
// performance test's own (perf::FrameStart); the crowds' CPU from the hooks here: the game's per-frame update of every
// placement (0x143B9B7E0: its respawns, its step and the rules in it, its render copy), and inside it the game's own car
// and walker steps and the rules. Not taken out in the second phase: the room (the crowds' columns stay sized for the
// raised counts) and the game's car step still moving the unseen cars (its time is in the CPU numbers).
