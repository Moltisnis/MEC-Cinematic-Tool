// Walking crowds (2026-11-03; Research_Road_Traffic_2026-11-03.md section 8): the rules the tools add to the game's own
// walker step (0x143B8CF00, the Pedestrians behaviour), with nothing of the game in here, so the same code runs in the
// DLL and in the offline test that walks the city's 114 walking placements with a copy of the game's step. The game's
// walkers never slow down: its avoidance (0x143B87690) only turns them away from the walkers in front of them on their
// own two nodes, so a walker it can't turn away in time walks through the other, two placements on one path never see
// each other, and a respawn comes in on its spawn node whoever is there. Per walking placement, after the game's step:
// - a shown walker never ends a step closer than a body (0.5 - 0.6 m, centre to centre) to another shown walker, its own
//   placement's or another's: its move is cut short (it keeps the game's heading, so the game's own avoidance turns it
//   away and it goes round); a pair already that close may only move apart;
// - a walker the game respawns starts unseen and shows once its spot is clear; one found inside another after all the
//   moves (two placements' walkers meeting) goes back, and if that doesn't help the younger waits unseen;
// - the time of day's share of them shows (Density, from the caller): above it, shown walkers out of sight (far from
//   the view, or off to its side) go unseen; below it, unseen ones out of sight show again.
// An unseen walker is at y -10000 (RoadTrafficCore.h, HiddenY: never -10042, the game's despawn height) and stands
// still: the caller marks it despawned for the game's step only (the step skips despawned members, 0x143B8D096), so
// the game neither walks it nor turns a shown walker away from it (its avoidance goes by 3D distance).
