//
// The user, Faith standing at a fence gate in a passage of downtown area 5 (-268.8, 0, 39.4): "While solid street is
// active the fence that faith is next to right now should get removed". It's five pieces of the city's static model
// groups (fence_01_128_electric and fence_01_256_electric, 10 cm thick, 3.2 m tall), in two zones' groups, each with
// its own collision; behind it a 3.9 m wide passage to the street (whose kill floor Solid street spares her in).
// Taken away the way Dogen's door is opened (DogenDoor.cpp, its research file): each piece's member found by its mesh,
// its instance count and its first physics part (each set unique in sp_maincity's 2,392 files, offline), its draw
// object checked to be where the data puts it, its collision parts switched off on its group's physics component's
// bodies (slot 60, as the member's Enabled event does; slot 59 back on) and its instance hidden (the group's Visible,
// util::hooks::SetModelGroupMemberVisible; the renderer's handle at + 0x8C, -1 while not drawn). Collision first, then
// hidden; one that can't be hidden gets its collision back (it's gone or there, never one without the other). Back once
// Solid street is off and Faith is clear of it. A zone streamed in again comes as its file has it: looked at each frame
// while one is near or taken away. The same electric fence pieces are used in 546 places, so only these instances.

// ---- The Sky City station's collision reshaped (2026-11-10; Research_Ground_Level_2026-11-01.md section 24)
//
// The user, after the station's floors were made solid (section 23): "reshape it so the base block doesn't have any
// death zones etc", then of the walkway outside its north end: "make sure that the outside balcony area is solid as
// well" and "there is also an invisible wall preventing from going there". Two convex shapes of zone 55's static group
// collision (the zone body's root shape, as its file stores it: two Havok packfiles, these objects the same bytes in
// both; offline, reshape/hullfind.py):
// - Sky City's base block (skycity_building_01_mesh's part 7225, hkworld leaf 72654): a box under the whole of Sky
//   City (its frame's u -195.8 .. 159.6, h 72.9 .. 107.3) that fills the station's lowest floor, its pools and its hall
//   6.7 m deep (Faith walked on its top over the hall, CT.log 2026-11-09 23:03 - 23:08). Its west face is moved east to
//   u -73.54, 5 cm past what's drawn at the hall's east end: its 4 west vertices' x and that plane's d (block/
//   b16_final.py). A shrink needs nothing else: the compounds' trees only have to hold it. What that takes away outside
//   the hall, Street level's props put back exactly (the fill: reshape/skycity2gen.py).
// - The station exterior's north wedge (its part 6753's hull 3 of 3, leaf 71840): its south face is the invisible wall
//   across the walkway's doorway (v 62.2 of the station's frame; Faith stopped at it, 23:05), its inside fills the
//   walkway's end and the upper floor's north band. Shrunk to a 4 cm copy of itself about a point 5.4 m inside
//   skycity_building_01's leaf 72657, which stays: its vertices pulled in, its planes' d with them, its normals, faces
//   and indices as they are (reshape/hullcollapse.py). What it held (the north roof, the walls round the walkway),
//   Street level's props stand in for (the exterior's and interior's drawn triangles there, as boxes).
// - The low ceiling over the hall's east end (2026-11-10, the user: "Yes, fix it"; section 25): skycity_building_01's
//   leaves 72657, 72678, 72679 and 72656 come down to 1.6 - 2.5 m over the hall's floor. Each is cut at the base
//   block's top (h 107.28835, the leaves' local y 102.57965088): what they lose outside the hall lies inside the
//   block's old box (the block's kept part, or Street level's fill for it), or is a sliver under the 1 cm convex
//   radius. 72678 and 72679 keep their faces (vertices moved); 72657 and 72656 get new arrays and smaller counts
//   (72657 faces 20 -> 18; 72656 planes 24 -> 20, faces 21 -> 19), the offsets as they are. Made twice offline,
//   independently, byte for byte the same (ceiling/C and ceiling/verify/G), checked against the file's 2,213
//   polytopes' rules and the game's readers of them (verify/V2, V3).
// Each is found as DogenDoor.cpp's fill blocks are: the member (mesh, instance count, first part, parts a instance:
// each set unique in sp_maincity's files) -> its group's physics component -> each body's record -> its Havok body's
// shape (the zone's root) -> the convex object at its distance from the root in the first packfile or the second,
// checked byte for byte (headers, vertices, planes, faces, indices); written in the physics flush of its bodies' world
// (no step runs then; the camera hook only asks), in the order that keeps a read in between near the old shape or the
// new (Write), then the body's caches renewed (0x143F3CD00) as the game does after its collision changes, and again at
// that world's next flush. Changed while Solid street is on and the props data has
// the stand-ins (DataProbes), once nothing is lost under Faith: she isn't in or on the space it opens, or Street
// level's boxes within NearMadeRadius of her have been made for ChangeAfterMs. Back as its file has it once Solid
// street is off and she isn't in that space (on or over a top of it is fine: it comes back under her feet); till then
// Street level stays on (g_SkyHolding). A zone streamed in again comes as its file has it.
