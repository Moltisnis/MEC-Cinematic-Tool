// Road traffic (2026-11-03; Research_Road_Traffic_2026-11-03.md section 7): the rules the tools add to the game's own
// car step (0x143B8B0D0), with nothing of the game in here, so the same code runs in the DLL and in the offline test
// that drives the city's car network with a copy of the game's step. Per car placement, after the game's step:
// - each car follows its lane: the road segment's lane samples (RoadTrafficLanes.h: on the carriageway's tarmac),
//   joined at the nodes and rounded by a look-ahead along them, instead of chasing the next corner at a capped turn
//   rate; the game's own speed choice is kept as the most it may go;
// - a car never gets closer than a bumper gap to a car in its way (its own placement's, and the other car
//   placements' latest), slowing before it; of two crossing cars the one nearer the meeting point goes;
// - a car that would show inside another (two placements' cars meeting) waits unseen where it is until there's room,
//   a car the game respawns starts unseen and shows once its spawn point is clear, and one on a segment with no road
//   under it drives it unseen;
// - the time of day's share of the cars shows (StepInput::Density, DayShare): above it, shown cars out of sight go
//   unseen and drive on unseen; below it, unseen ones out of sight show again where they're in a gap (OutOfSight).
// The game's record of a car (0x24 bytes): position, heading (half, degrees), side offset s (half), the corner it
// drives to, from / to / next node, speed factor (half). Its node array: 0x30 bytes a node, position at + 0, radius
// at + 0x14.
