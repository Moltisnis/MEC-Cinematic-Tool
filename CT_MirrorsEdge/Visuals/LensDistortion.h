// VISUALS > Filmic effects > Lens distortion, drawn by the tools. The game
// bends the picture in its tonemap pass, but its depth of field (the Simple
// one) runs after that pass and looks the depth up where the pixel would be
// without the bend, so the blur landed beside what it should blur; and the
// tools' own passes at Present (wet surfaces, rain, snow, lightning, green
// screen) were drawn straight over a bent picture. So while the change here
// wants it, the game's own is off and the same bend (its formula, see
// LensDistortion.hlsl) is given to the finished frame at Present, after the
// tools' passes and before the Panini projection.
