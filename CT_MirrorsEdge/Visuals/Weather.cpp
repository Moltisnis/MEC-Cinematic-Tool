// Weather (2026-10-25, offline; Research_Weather_2026-10-25.md). The game has
// no weather system: its rain is effects placed in a few city prop zones of
// the Release district (centralcityprops_zs_zs_293 / 296 / 312 / 315 / 595 /
// 753, layer 0, AutoStart). One of them, FX/Ambient/Rain/FX_Rain_Camprox
// (zone 753), is the rain around the camera: its streak emitters spawn in a
// box around the camera (CameraProximityEvaluatorData) wherever the effect
// is, but the effect is culled 150 m from where it was placed; zone 293's
// FX_Rain_Camprox_Thickener adds more (culled at 60 m). So the tools keep the
// game's own instances at the camera.
//
// A placed effect (EffectEntity) doesn't go through the effect manager's play
// (0x14329B860, what the effect hooks see): its start (0x1430600D0) goes to the
// emitter system itself (0x1430F02D0, 0x1430F9150), so the hooks never saw the
// rain (2026-10-25 17:0x, the game's log: no start of it in a whole session
// with its zone loaded). Its instance (the object at EffectEntity + 0x50, its
// first qword its EffectEntityData) is in the client effect manager's list of
// them, [[0x142416160] + 0x48C0 .. + 0x48C8] (pointers), which the manager's
// culling (0x1432A1FF0 -> 0x1432905B0) goes over: farther from every view
// than its CullDistance (data + 0x78) it's culled (0x14305F350: stopped,
// remembered as playing, + 0x1B8 bit 0x20), and started again when it's back
// in range. Its place is the 4x4 at + 0x100; a Transform property puts the new
// one there, sets + 0x1B8 bit 2 and calls 0x1430606F0(instance) (the
// EffectEntity's handler 0x14305F010). The tools find the rain's instances by
// their first emitter's name (data + 0x60 its components, the first an
// EmitterEntityData: + 0xA0 its emitter document, + 0x28 the high quality
// EmitterTemplateData, + 0x158 its DebugName; the documents themselves have
// no names), move them to the camera the same way while Rain is on (so they're
// never culled and play), and give them back their place when it's off. They
// exist only while their zones are loaded: the tools' streaming loads them
// (ZonePoints, the effects' places).
//
// Rain kept out of buildings: the game culls a rain particle inside an
// emitter exclusion volume. The rain's emitters have ExclusionVolumeCullEnable
// (EmitterTemplateData + 0x165): at the end of each emitter's update
// (0x1430629D0 -> 0x1430F23C0) every particle is tested against the volumes
// near the emitter (gathered by 0x1430E7620, 32 at most). The level's volumes
// are boxes placed by hand in the Release interiors
// (EmitterExclusionVolumeEntity). They live in a manager at [0x1423E4148]:
// + 0x00 / + 0x08 a stack of freed slots (u16; + 0x10 its end), + 0x820 how
// many slots are in use (at most 0x400), a box per slot set by
// 0x1430FBDE0(manager, slot, its 4x4: the axes' lengths are the box's sizes,
// the translation its middle). An entity takes a slot from the stack or the
// next one (0x1430F4DF0) and gives it back with the box at 0x1423E41F0 (a unit
// box at 100000, 100000, 100000) onto the stack (0x1430F4E9C); the emitter
// system copies them every update (0x1430F40F4). The tools do the same with
// boxes of their own: around the camera an upward sweep from each 2 m square
// looks for a roof (the camera collision's sweep), and the squares under one
// become a few boxes from under the camera up to just below it.

// The sound system as the hooks have it (Util/Hooks.cpp): a voice made for a
// sound asset (0x143019860), placed (0x14301DC30), given an event (0x14301D5F0)

// in the rain zones (FX_Ambient_Rain_Opening_Large, five in zone 753) carry a
// rain sound of their own (ME_Sound/World/Shared/Rain/SpotRainOpeningLarge,
// me_rain_medium), made when one plays (in its 50 m: one is moved under the
// camera for a moment if none has). The hooks see the game make its voice and
// give it its first events; the tools make a voice of their own for that sound (as the
// replay does, the voice manager [0x1423E29B8]), give it the same events and
// keep it at the camera, or under a roof at the nearest square open to the

// environment manager's ([0x142568CD8]) view with ids 0, 0 (0x1436FC5E0: the

// + 0x560; with no such view, the manager's + 0x60): the Values of the
// state's three EmitterParam slots (+ 0x12A0, 0x1C each: + 0 Realm, + 4

// (0x1430FA0C0, from its update 0x1430F3A50), and an emitter made later gets
// them as it's made (0x1430FAF30). A visual environment's EmitterParamComponent
// fills the slot of its Parameter (0x14328D5D1). In the city the always-on
// ve_tod_posteffects gives slot 2 (EmitterParameter3) 0, so the rain the
// tools keep at the camera spawned nothing; the Release mission's
// ve_release_01 - 04 give it 0.7, 0.5, 0.12 and 0, its interiors 0. The mix
// (0x143703D60, the hook's) writes the slots only when the view is mixed again

  // that copy (0x14373E74D -> 0x1436FAB20), before the tools' writes to its
  // copy land; so values the sky and the sun are made from (the sky's
  // scattering, its OutdoorLightScale and DrawSunDisc) never took: the 20:16

  // mixed state right after each mix (as the rain's strength is), every step
  // after sees them. The fields are the state's (SkyComponentData's and the
  // others' data offsets minus 0x80, from their type info).
  //
  // No sun: the time of day's logic (pf_tod_sunmooncelectialandoutdoorlightlogic,
  // TimeOfDaySkyAndCelestialLogicEntityData) drives the sky's OutdoorLightScale
  // (0 at night, 0.6 from 7:00 to 17:00), Light1Intensity (200, the sky's own
  // sun) and DrawSunDisc: the sun's light on the city is the sky's sun times
  // OutdoorLightScale, so that going to 0 takes the direct light and its
  // shadows away while the sky stays lit; DrawSunDisc off hides its disk,
  // MieG towards 0 its glow (the haze scatters evenly).
  //
  // But with the physical sky the mix works out the sun's final light itself
  // at its end (0x1437050D4 - 0x1437051A3: with the sky block's + 0x270 set
  // and SkyType (+ 0x484) 2 it calls 0x143729430, which fills the outdoor
  // light's FinalSunLuminance + 0x10 / FinalSunIlluminance + 0x20 and the
  // outer space ones from the sky's own sun; only otherwise from SunColor x
  // SunIntensity), so OutdoorLightScale 0 left the sun's light as it was (the
  // 20:37 test: read live, FinalSunIlluminance 79 58 46 with OutdoorLightScale 0
  // in both states). Given right after the mix, the final values stay until
  // the next mix: they're taken down too. For the overcast look, also more
  // bloom (Tonemap BloomScale + 0x1D0) and heavier, flatter-lit clouds.
  //
  // Fog everywhere: the sky's MinHeightFogTransmittance (+ 0x24C, read by the
  // fog set-up at 0x143706B24) is a floor on how much the fog lets through:
  // 0.37 at 6:00, 0.6 at 7:00, 0.73 at noon, 0 at 17:00 (the time of day's
  // environments), so in the morning and at noon the fog could hardly be
  // seen (the user, 20:2x: "the fog went away"). The game's own foggy

  // x 0.25 at midnight; 0 at 7:00 and 17:00 as the game's), forward
  // scattering from 300 to 7500 m by day (150 - 3750 m at night, the game's
